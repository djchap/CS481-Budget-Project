## Summary
We can use a smart contract to automatically allocate funds between accounts and prevent the user from misallocating funds or spending money prematurely. The user would only be able to add money to Holdings and remove money from Spending. They would be able to view the balance of their Budget accounts but could not manipulate them. This project would support a single user managing their money, as well as multiple users budgeting for an organization.
